# 📦 tests

A small Java project created to practice **unit testing** using **JUnit 5**.

## 🧪 What this project is about

This repository is part of my learning journey to understand:

- ✅ How to write clean and readable unit tests in Java  
- ✅ How to use **JUnit 5** and **Assertions**  
- ✅ How to test small methods in isolation (Test-Driven Thinking)  
- ✅ How to organize test classes and methods with clarity  

## 📁 Project structure

```
/tests
 ├── src/
 │   └── NumberChecker.java          # Example class with logic to test
 └── test/
     └── TestingMethods.java         # Unit tests for NumberChecker
```

## 🚀 How to run the tests

1. Make sure you have **Java 17+** and **JUnit 5** set up in your environment.
2. Use any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java Extension Pack.
3. Run the test class `TestingMethods.java`.

If you’re using Maven or Gradle, make sure `junit-jupiter` is added as a dependency.

## 🔧 Technologies used

- Java 17+
- JUnit 5 (`org.junit.jupiter.api`)
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

## 🎯 Why this repo exists

This is a simple sandbox for learning, testing, and improving my skills in writing unit tests following **Clean Code** principles.
